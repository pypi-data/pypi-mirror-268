    This is the simplest probabilistic model implemented in this package. This is used for binary EDAs where
    all the solutions are binary. The implementation involves a vector of independent probabilities [0, 1].
    When sampling, a random float is sampled [0, 1]. If the float is below the probability, then the sampling
    is a 1. Thus, the probabilities show probabilities of a sampling being 1.
