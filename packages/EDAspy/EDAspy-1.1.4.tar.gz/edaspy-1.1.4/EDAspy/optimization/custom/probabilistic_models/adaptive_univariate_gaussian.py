    This class implements the adaptive univariate Gaussians. With this implementation we are updating N univariate
    Gaussians in each iteration. When a dataset is given, each column is updated independently. The implementation
    involves a matrix with two rows, in which the first row are the means and the second one, are the standard
    deviations. Each Gaussian mean is updates as follows, where the two best individuals and the worst are considered.
