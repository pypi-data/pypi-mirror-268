    """
    Estimation of Gaussian Networks Algorithm. This type of Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithm uses
    a Gaussian Bayesian Network from where new solutions are sampled. This multivariate probabilistic
    model is updated in each iteration with the best individuals of the previous generation.

    EGNA [1] has shown to improve the results for more complex optimization problem compared to the
    univariate EDAs that can be found implemented in this package. Different modifications have been
    done into this algorithm such as in [2] where some evidences are input to the Gaussian Bayesian
    Network in order to restrict the search space in the landscape.

    Example:

        This example uses some very well-known benchmarks from CEC14 conference to be solved using
        an Estimation of Gaussian Networks Algorithm (EGNA).
