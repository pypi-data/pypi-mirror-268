    Univariate marginal Estimation of Distribution algorithm binary. New individuals are sampled
    from a univariate binary probabilistic model. It can be used for hyper-parameter optimization
    or to optimize a function.

    UMDA [1] is a specific type of Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) where new individuals
    are sampled from univariate binary distributions and are updated in each iteration of the
    algorithm by the best individuals found in the previous iteration. In this implementation each
    individual is an array of 0s and 1s so new individuals are sampled from a univariate probabilistic
    model updated in each iteration. Optionally it is possible to set lower and upper bound to the
    probabilities to avoid premature convergence.

    This approach has been widely used and shown to achieve very good results in a wide range of
    problems such as Feature Subset Selection or Portfolio Optimization.

    Example:

        This short example runs UMDAd for a toy example of the One-Max problem.
