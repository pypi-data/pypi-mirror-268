    Univariate marginal Estimation of Distribution algorithm continuous. New individuals are sampled
    from a univariate normal probabilistic model. It can be used for hyper-parameter optimization
    or to optimize a function.

    UMDA [1] is a specific type of Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) where new individuals
    are sampled from univariate normal distributions and are updated in each iteration of the
    algorithm by the best individuals found in the previous iteration. In this implementation each
    individual is an array of real data so new individuals are sampled from a univariate probabilistic
    model updated in each iteration. Optionally it is possible to set lower bound to the standard
    deviation of the normal distribution for the variables to avoid premature convergence.

    This algorithms has been widely used for different applications such as in [2] where it is
    applied to optimize the parameters of a quantum paremetric circuit and is shown how it outperforms
    other approaches in specific situations.

    Example:

        This short example runs UMDAc for a benchmark function optimization problem in the continuous space.
