***************
Release Process
***************

All releases are PGP signed with one of the keys listed in the
`installation page`_. Before releasing please make sure your PGP key is listed
there, and preferably signed by one of the other key holders.

If your key is not signed by one of the other key holders, please make sure the
PR that added your key to the :doc:`../about` page was approved by at least one
other maintainer.

After that is done, you may release the project by following these steps:

#. Release to the Git repository on GitHub:

   #. Create the release commit

      #. Bump the versions in ``meson.build`` and ``mesonpy/__init__.py``.
      #. Create ``CHANGELOG.rst`` section for the new release and fill it.
      #. The commit message should read: ``REL: set version to X.Y.Z``

   #. Create a GPG-signed tag for the release:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ git tag -s X.Y.Z

      The tag title should follow the ``meson-python X.Y.Z`` format, and the
      tag body should be a plain text version of the change-log for the current
      release.

   #. Push the commit and tag to the repository:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ git push
         $ git push --tags

#. Release to `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/meson-python/>`_

   #. Build the Python artifacts:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ python -m build

   #. Push the artifacts to PyPI:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ twine upload dist/*

      There is no need to GPG-sign the artifacts: PyPI no longer
      supports uploading GPG signatures.

If you have any questions, please look at previous releases and/or ping the
other maintainers.
