* Contributing
My development environment for this project relies on using a nix flake and poetry, facilitated by devenv. To get set up, you'll need nix package manager, and direnv with nix-direnv installed. Once you have those, entering the project directory should automatically activate the flake, giving you an environment with all of the dependencies provided.
* Features to add
- [ ] message styling
- [ ] tests
- [ ] automated testing and deployment with actions
