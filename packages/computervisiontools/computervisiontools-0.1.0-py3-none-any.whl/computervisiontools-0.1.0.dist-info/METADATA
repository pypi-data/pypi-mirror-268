Torch overlay for trainning and inference processes for object detection & instance segmentation tasks. 

## ðŸ’ª Context

computervisiontools is developped by INRAE (french National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment) for the [PHENOME-EMPHASIS project](https://www.phenome-emphasis.fr/)

## Install

computervisiontools has mostly been tested under Python 3.10 (even if it should work with later versions). We recommend using 3.10.

In your python environment run 

```
pip install computervisiontools
```


## Code access and documentation

Source code  documentation will be accessible soon.
