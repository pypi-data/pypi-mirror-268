## Overview

**spectral-recovery** is an open-source project and Python package that provides computationally simple, centralized, and reproducible methods for performing [spectral recovery analysis](https://people-er.github.io/Spectral-Recovery/about/#13-looking-at-recovery-trajectories) of forests using satellite imagery.

The package provides straight-forward interfaces to help coordinate the many moving parts of spectral recovery analysis. Users provide restoration site locations, restoration dates, and annual composites of spectral data, while spectral-recovery handles computing the spectral indices, recovery targets, recovery metrics, and more!

The package aims, through both software and supplementary documentation, to make spectral recovery analysis more approachable, encouraging the use and adoption of well-founded remote sensing techniques to aid [Ecosystem Restoration](https://people-er.github.io/Spectral-Recovery/about/#11-ecosystem-restoration) research and projects.

## Installation

```{bash}
pip install spectral-recovery
