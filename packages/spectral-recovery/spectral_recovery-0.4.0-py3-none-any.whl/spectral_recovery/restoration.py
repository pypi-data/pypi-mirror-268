"""Restoration Area class and helper methods.

The RestorationArea class coordinates the spectral data, dates,
polygons, and recovery target logic/computation, that is used
to fully define a restoration area. The expectation is for
RestorationArea instances to be passed to recovery metric
methods, so that each method can have encapsulated access to
relevant restoration site information.
