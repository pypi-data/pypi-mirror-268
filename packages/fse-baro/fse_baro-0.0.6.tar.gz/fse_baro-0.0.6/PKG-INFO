[![Build and test](https://github.com/phamquiluan/baro/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/phamquiluan/baro/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)


In the progress of preparing the Artifact submission:
- Deadline 30/4
- https://2024.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2024-artifacts#submission-for-replicated-and-reproduced-badges
- Can apply for all three badges: Available, Function, Reusable

TODO:

- [ ] reproduce RobustScorer
- [ ] reproduce BOCPD
- [ ] make the API
- [ ] restructure + lint code
- [ ] better readme
- [ ] make a Helm chart

## Installation

Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phamquiluan/baro.git && cd baro
pip install -e .
```

Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fse-baro)
