# WhatsFly
## Just run and have fun. Just try and go fly. 

WhatsApp web wrapper in Python. No selenium nor gecko web driver needed. 

Setting up browser driver are tricky for python newcomers, and thus it makes your code so 'laggy'.

I knew that feeling. It's so painful.

So I make WhatsFly, implementing Whatsmeow --a golang based WhatsApp library. It will make his wrapper easy to use without sacrificing the speed and perfomance.

## Installation

```bash
  pip install whatsfly
```

or :
```bash
  pip install --upgrade whatsfly
```

## Usage/Examples

```javascript
from whatsfly import WhatsApp

chat = WhatsApp()

# send mesage
chat.send_message(phone="6283139750000", message="Hello World!")

# send image
chat.send_image(phone="6283139750000", image_path="path/to/image.jpg" caption="Hello World!")
```
