# Overview
Pasta-Man is a software application designed to securely store passwords and sensitive information in an encrypted format. It provides users with a convenient way to manage their passwords, ensuring they are protected from unauthorized access. 

## Motivation
 - In the digital login password age we need a one stop vault for storing all our login credentials with concerned of atmost  security.
 - The repeated use of single password in multiple accounts may lead to data breach or loss of data.
 - Weak passwords are easy to interpreat for attackers, use of strong passwords is recommended,but it is difficult to remember complex passwords.
 - Mostly passwords written in somewhere lead to comprosing of data and privacy of user.

## Features
 <!-- - Securely Managing Passwords
 - Copy passwords to the clipboard
 - One master password for all
 - Exporting all passwords in desired file format
 - Encrypting passwords
 - Search Password by target name/username -->

### Secure Management of Passwords
`Pasta-Man` uses tripple layer encryption for saving passwords. Once `Pasta-Man` is provided with a password to manage, it encrypts it with a Master Password and stores it in a file, which then again is encrypted with the master password. The so called Master password is stored as an encrypted string (this encryption is done using password and salt not known to users.).

The user will be prompted to provide a master password if it is the first use. If not, `Pasta-Man` will work as usual.

### Tags
`Pasta-Man` stores passwords with tags such as target (the target application or link or any platform the password is meant for), target-type (target-type can be an app or link or any other category defined by the user. --- `Pasta-Man` supports creation of user defined tags and can easily fetch search results for the same.).

### Search
User can search for passwords using keywords in keyword-types.

`For Example:`<br>
If there is a target (say, abcde) which contains a keyword (say, abc), the user can search `abc` in `keyword-type == target`. Similarly, if there is a target-type (say, link) which contains a keyword (say, github), the user can search for `github` in `keyword-type == target-type`.

### Copy to Clipboard
Upon [Search](#search), `Pasta-Man` allows to copy the password for the found match to user's clipboard (given, the user provides the master password), instead of revealing it because of bad management. `Pasta-Man` also allows to Remove that match search result.

### Faster than basic tkinter apps
`Pasta-Man` actively uses Threads to carry out intensive tasks in order to minimize GUI lag as well as have better performance than any basic app created through python tkinter lib.

### Themes
User can now change Theme for the app from the Menu Bar. Default is `Arc`. Whatever theme the user chooses, It will be set as default and next time `Pasta-Man` is launched, that theme will be loaded.

Themes can be changed using the MenuBar -
