Torch overlay for trainning and inference processes for semantic segmentation tasks. 

## ðŸ’ª Context

Segmentools is developped by INRAE (french National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment) for the [PHENOME-EMPHASIS project](https://www.phenome-emphasis.fr/)

## Install

Segmentools has mostly been tested under Python 3.10 (even if it should work with later versions). We recommend using 3.10.

In your python environment run 

```
pip install segmentools
```

## Code access and documentation

Source code  documentation will be accessible soon.
