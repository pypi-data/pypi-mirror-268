class OFDM:
    """
    OFDM encoder and decoder. The data is encoded as 4-QAM so two bits per frequency sample. Energy
    dispersal is done with a pre-seeded random number generator. Both pilot tones
    and the cyclic prefix are added so that the start of the symbol can be detected at the receiver.
    The complex time series after the inverse Fourier Transform is modulated into a real valued stream
    with a Nyquist quadrature modulator. On the receiver side the start of the symbol is detected by
    first doing a coarse search with the cyclic prefix and then a precision alignment with the pilots.
