## Using MSCSol to predict moleculer solubility

### MSCSol

[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/MSCSol)](https://pepy.tech/project/MSCSol)

Our trained model has been uploaded to PyPI, accessible through this link (https://pypi.org/project/MSCSol/). We've included detailed installation instructions and usage guidelines, making it easy to obtain prediction results by inputting SMILES strings.


### Installation

```
pip install MSCSol
```

### Quick Start

```
import MSCSol

MSCSol.pred(<your_SMILES>)
```

### Note

It will take some time to calculate the molecular signatures, so please be patient for a while. Also note that dipole moment features are not used here as they cannot be obtained directly by calling the code. 

The training data was restricted to molecular weights less than or equal to 504, LogS values greater than or equal to -8, and experimental temperatures of 20-25 degrees Celsius, so if the molecule does not apply to the above conditions, the prediction results may have a large deviation. 

In addition, due to the computational requirements of the node vector feature of the GVP-GNN, the input molecule atom number must be greater than or equal to 3.
