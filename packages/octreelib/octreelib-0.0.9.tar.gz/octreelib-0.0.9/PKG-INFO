Octreelib is a Python library for working with octrees.
It is capable of processing point clouds and using octrees to store them.
It is also capable of working with a grid of octrees of fixed resolution and processing multiple distinct point clouds
in the same grid synchronizing their subdivision schemes.

# Installation

To install the latest version of the library, run

```shell
pip install octreelib
```

To install a specific version, use **tags**, for example tag `0.0.1`

```shell
pip install octreelib==0.0.1
```
