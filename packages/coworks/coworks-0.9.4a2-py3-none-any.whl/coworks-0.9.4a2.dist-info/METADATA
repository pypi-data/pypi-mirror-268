CoWorks is a unified serverless microservices framework based on AWS technologies
(`API Gateway <https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/>`_, `AWS Lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_),
the Flask framework (`Flask <https://github.com/pallets/flask>`_/`Click <https://github.com/pallets/click>`_) and
the `Airflow <https://github.com/apache/airflow>`_ platform.

The aim of this project is to offer a very simplified experience of microservices. For such purpose, we divided the
CoWorks framework in two levels:

**Small technical microservice**

``TechMicroservice`` are each composed of simple python `Flask <https://github.com/pallets/flask>`_ application and deployed as a serverless Lambda. Each ``TechMicroService`` is an ``atomic component`` or `atomic microservice <http://resources.fiorano.com/blog/microservices/>`_. These microservices may be called synchronously or asynchronously.

**Functional business service**

``biz`` are `composite business services <http://resources.fiorano.com/blog/microservices/>`_, which are `Airflow <https://github.com/apache/airflow>`_ DAGs providing orchestration of atomic microservices or components (aka: ``TechMicroService``).

To get started with CoWorks, first follow the `Installation Guide <https://coworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_. Then you can get a quickstart on `TechMicroService Quickstart <https://coworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tech_quickstart.html>`_.
Once familiar with ``TechMicroService``, you can continue with `BizMicroService Quickstart <https://coworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/biz_quickstart.html>`_.

**Data model**

The data model shared between those services may be structured with ``pydantic`` and using the JSON:API specification.
You can install this data protocol for CoWorks with: pip install coworks[jsonapi-sqlalchemy].
