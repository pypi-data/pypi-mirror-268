# :fire: FireANTs: Adaptive Riemannian Optimization for Multi-Scale Diffeomorphic Registration

The FireANTs library is a lightweight registration package for Riemannian diffeomorphic registration on GPUs.

## Installation 
To use the FireANTs package, you can either clone the repository and install the package locally or install the package directly from PyPI.
We recommend using a fresh Anaconda/Miniconda environment to install the package.
```
conda create -n fireants python=3.7
```

To install FireANTs locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/rohitrango/fireants
cd fireants
pip install -e .
```

Or install from PyPI:
```
pip install fireants
```

## Tutorial
To check out some of the tutorials, check out the `tutorials/` directory for usage.
Alternatively, to reproduce the results in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01249) checkout the `fireants/scripts/` directory.

## Datasets
In the paper, we use the datasets as following: 
* Klein's evaluation of 14 non-linear registration algorithms: [here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3251018)
* EMPIRE10 lung registration challenge: [here](https://empire10.grand-challenge.org/)
* Expansion Microscopy dataset: [here](https://rnr-exm.grand-challenge.org/)
