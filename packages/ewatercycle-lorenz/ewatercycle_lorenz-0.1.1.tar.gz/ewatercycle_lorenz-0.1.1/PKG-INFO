This package is based on the [Leaky bucket](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle-leakybucket/tree/main) & is a wrapper for the [lorenz-bmi](https://github.com/Daafip/lorenz-bmi) model. 

The Lorenz-96 model as defined by Edward Lorenz (in 1996) is known for its chaotic behavior and thus often used in data assimilation. 

This is the main reason for implementation on a hydrology platform: to test data assimilation techniques.

## Installation
Install this package alongside your eWaterCycle installation

```console
pip install ewatercycle-lorenz
```

Then HBV becomes available as one of the eWaterCycle models

```python
from ewatercycle.models import Lorenz
```
## Documentation
Some basic documentation can be found [here](https://ewatercycle-lorenz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Changelog
Changes can be found in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Daafip/ewatercycle-lorenz/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) on GitHub

## Implementing your own model

For more information on how this plugin works, and on how to implement your own model see the [plugin guide](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle-leakybucket/blob/main/plugin_guide.md)
