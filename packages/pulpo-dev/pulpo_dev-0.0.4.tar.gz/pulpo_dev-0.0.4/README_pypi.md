## üìç Overview

The project, "pulpo," is a life cycle assessment (LCA) optimization tool that aims to import, optimize, solve, retrieve, save, and summarize LCA results. It provides functionalities for data import from the Ecoinvent database, conversion of inputs into a dictionary for the optimization model, definition and solving of the optimization model using the pyomo package, and saving and summarizing of the model results. The tool's value lies in streamlining LCA processes, enabling optimization and analysis of environmental impacts, and facilitating the decision-making process for sustainable solutions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîß Installation
You can now install PULPO via pip:

```sh
pip install pulpo-dev
```

This will install PULPO and all its dependencies. It is advised to create a new venv/conda environment for 
performing tasks with PULPO, in order to avoid package conflicts with other tools such as brightway, activity-browser, 
or premise.

### ü§ñ Running pulpo
After installing PULPO, check if the package has been set up properly by running the setup function:
```sh
from pulpo.utils import tests

tests.setup()
```
This function mimics the development test functions and if all tests have passed you are good to go.

To learn the PULPO workflow for more complex case studies, find example notebooks for a [hydrogen case](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/master/notebooks/hydrogen_showcase.ipynb) and an [electricity case](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/master/notebooks/electricity_showcase.ipynb) here.

You can also follow these notebooks locally with the shipped package by calling:
```sh
from pulpo import pulpo

pulpo.electricity_showcase()
pulpo.hydrogen_showcase()
```

It should be noted that to run these showcase it is necessary to install the ecoinvent cutoff38 system model via brightway2/activity-browser.
Please follow instructions on [Brightway2](https://learn.brightway.dev/en/latest/content/notebooks/BW2_for_beginners.html) or
[Activity-Browser](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser) to see how this is done.
