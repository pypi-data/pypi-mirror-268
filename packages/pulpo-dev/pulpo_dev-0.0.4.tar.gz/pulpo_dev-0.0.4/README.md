## 📍 Overview

The project, "pulpo," is a life cycle assessment (LCA) optimization tool that aims to import, optimize, solve, retrieve, save, and summarize LCA results. It provides functionalities for data import from the Ecoinvent database, conversion of inputs into a dictionary for the optimization model, definition and solving of the optimization model using the pyomo package, and saving and summarizing of the model results. The tool's value lies in streamlining LCA processes, enabling optimization and analysis of environmental impacts, and facilitating the decision-making process for sustainable solutions.

| [pulpo.py](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/main/pulpo\pulpo.py)                                   | The code implements a PulpoOptimizer class that provides functionalities for data import, optimization, solving, retrieval, saving and summarizing results related to life cycle assessments. It uses modules like optimizer, bw_parser, converter, and saver for different operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [bw_parser.py](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/main/pulpo\utils\bw_parser.py)                     | The code in `bw_parser.py` provides functions for importing, saving, and retrieving life cycle inventory (LCI) data from the Ecoinvent database using the Brightway2 library. It includes functions for importing data, checking if data needs to be reloaded, performing LCA calculations, saving LCI data to files, and reading LCI data from files. Additionally, it provides functions for retrieving activities and environmental flows from the database based on specified criteria. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of these functions. |
| [converter.py](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/main/pulpo\utils\converter.py)                     | The code in pulpo\utils\converter.py combines various inputs into a dictionary for an optimization model. It converts sparse matrices to dictionaries, modifies the technosphere matrix, creates sets, specifies demand, limits, and supply, assigns weights, and assembles the final data dictionary for the model. This function serves as a crucial step in preparing the inputs for the optimization process.                                                                                                                                          |
| [optimizer.py](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/main/pulpo\utils\optimizer.py)                     | The code defines an optimization model using the pyomo package. It includes sets, parameters, variables, constraints, and an objective function. The model is created and solved using different solvers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [saver.py](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo/blob/main/pulpo\utils\saver.py)                             | The code provides two main functionalities:1. save_results: Saves the results of a Pyomo model to an Excel file, including raw results, metadata, and constraints.2. summarize_results: Prints a summary of the model results, including demand, impacts, choices, and constraints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
