    Constrain the angle from the Sun-illuminated portion of the Earth limb.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min : :class:`astropy.units.Quantity`
        Minimum angular separation from the Earth's limb.

    Notes
    -----
    This makes the extremely conservative simplifying assumption that the
    entire Earth is illuminated except during orbit night.
