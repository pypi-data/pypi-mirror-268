# ElbowPlot

ElbowPlot is a Python library designed to help visualize the optimal number of clusters for K-means clustering using the elbow method. This visualization aids in determining the point at which the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) begins to diminish, indicating the optimal number of clusters.

## Installation

Install ElbowPlot using pip:

```bash
pip install elbowplot
```
