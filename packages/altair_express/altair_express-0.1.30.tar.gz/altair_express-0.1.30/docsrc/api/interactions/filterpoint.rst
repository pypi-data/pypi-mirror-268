Filter Point
============

The filter_point() function is a data filtering technique that allows you to filter your data visualization by selecting a specific point in the plot. 
This function removes all non-selected points from the chart (but keeps the axes consistent).
This is particularly useful when investigating specific outliers or looking at a specific record of data.
For multi-point selection, we recommend you use :ref:`highlight-point`. 


Note: if you're using this to select marks separated by another encoding like 'color', you'll need to use the :ref:`highlight-color` function.
