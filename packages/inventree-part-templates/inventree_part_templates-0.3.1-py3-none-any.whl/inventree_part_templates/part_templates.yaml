# inventree-part-templates filter configuration file
# 
# filters are used with the Django "filter" tag to filter content according to a set of rules.
# Typically these are named after Part properties, such as "Package Type", to refine an improve
# inconsistencies in naming for reporting / label use.  
filters:

    # currently, InvenTree does not handle reporting with chinese characters (they
    # become spaces).  Until that is fixed, this rule removes them
