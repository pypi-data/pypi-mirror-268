The main changes to port Pylians to Pylians3 have been:

1) Change xrange() by range()
2) Change print "test" by print("test")
3) Change 5/2=2 (python2) to 5//2=2 (python3)
4) Check the mix usage of tabs and spaces (done with brackets)
5) Change depreciated functions, e.g. time.clock() by time.time()
