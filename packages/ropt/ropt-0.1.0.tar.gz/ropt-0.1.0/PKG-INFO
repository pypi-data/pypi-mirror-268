# `ropt`
`ropt` is a Python module for running robust optimization workflows.

`ropt` is developed by the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific
Research (TNO). All files in this repository are released under the GNU General
Public License v3.0 (a copy is provided in the LICENSE file).

Detailed documentation and examples can be found in the online manual (on
[GitHubPages](https://tno-ropt.github.io/ropt/) or on [Read the
Docs](https://ropt.readthedocs.io/)).

## Dependencies
`ropt` has been tested with Python versions 3.8-3.12.

`ropt` requires one or more optimization backends to function. A backend based
on optimizers included in [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) is installed by default.

## Installation
To install, enter the `ropt` distribution directory and execute:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Documentation
Documentation is written using [`MkDocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and
[`mkdocstrings`](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/). To view it, install the
necessary dependencies and start the `MkDocs` built-in server within the `ropt`
distribution directory:

```bash
pip install .[docs]
mkdocs serve
```

## Running the tests
To run the test suite, install the necessary dependencies and execute `pytest`:

```bash
pip install .[test]
pytest
```
