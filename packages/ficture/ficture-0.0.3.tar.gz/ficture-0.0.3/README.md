*This repository is under active construction*

Currently there are two main branches, the _stable_ branch is a version of FICTURE used in our internal pipeline; the _pypi_ branch is a version that is lagging behind the _stable_ branch but has all core functionalities and is available from pypi. In the near future we will merge these two branches and choose a consistent interface.
