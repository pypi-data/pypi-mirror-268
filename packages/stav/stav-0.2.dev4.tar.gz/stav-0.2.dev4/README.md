## STAV Taxonomy

Available at [https://w3id.org/stav](https://w3id.org/stav.)

## STAV Python module

STAV terms can also be accessible through a Python module called `stav`, available freely on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/stav/).

STAV class names are accessible through constants in the `stav` module. These class names are in capital letters with underscores separating words, `LIKE_THIS`, as stated in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#constants).
Values of these constants are simply a STAV class name, a string in `CamelCase`.

For example, `stav.INSTRUCTIONS_OF_USE` is a string with value of "InstructionsOfUse".
(In the future, it should be able to configure the casing to "instructions_of_use", etc.)

With this, it will make the standardization of documentation within an organization, or across organizations, easier and can facilitate the use of the terms in MLOps settings, where data scientists and data engineers can use STAV terms as keys in their model logging and registration.

### Installation

```console
pip install stav
```

### Use with MLflow

```python
from mlflow import log_artifact, log_metric, log_param
import stav

metric_names = [
    stav.METRICS_RECALL,
    stav.METRICS_PRECISION,
    stav.METRICS_RMSE,
]

log_param(stav.ENERGY_CONSUMPTION, "3.3M GPU")

log_param(stav.AI_PROVIDER, "Acme Corporation")
log_param(stav.AI_DEPLOYER, "Sirius Cybernetics")
log_artifact("use_intructions.txt", artifact_path=stav.INSTRUCTIONS_OF_USE)
```

## Sister projects

STA*V* (a *V*ocabulary) and STA*P* (an ODRL *P*rofile) are sisters for system trustworthiness and accountability.

- **STAV** provides a vocabulary (with focus on *informational items*) extracted from regulations and policy documents, mostly AI safety-related, like EU Artificial Intelligence Act draft. Its IRI is [https://w3id.org/stav](https://w3id.org/stav). Its code repository is at [https://github.com/bact/stav/](https://github.com/bact/stav/).

- **STAP** provides a set of core accountability relationships, based on [Open Digital Rights Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/). They are trying not to be AI-specific. Its IRI is [https://w3id.org/stap](https://w3id.org/stap). Its code repository is at [https://github.com/bact/stap/](https://github.com/bact/stap/).
