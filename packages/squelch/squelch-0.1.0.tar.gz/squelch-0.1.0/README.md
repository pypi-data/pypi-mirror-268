# squelch

Squelch is a package providing a Simple SQL REPL Command Handler.  Squelch uses SQLAlchemy for database access and so can support any database engine that SQLAlchemy supports, thereby providing a common database client experience for any of those database engines.  Squelch is modelled on a simplified `psql`, the PostgreSQL command line client.  The Squelch CLI supports readline history and basic SQL statement tab completions.
