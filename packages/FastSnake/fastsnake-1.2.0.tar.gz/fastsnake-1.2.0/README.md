# FastSnake

Tired of having to copy-paste your library code into every solution you write? FastSnake is a command-line tool that allows you to easily create, expand, run and test Python solutions for competitive programming problems.

This project provides useful CLI tools for competitive programming, such as algorithms and data structures, and tools for Codeforces. But you will have to write your own code and library for the problems you want to solve.
