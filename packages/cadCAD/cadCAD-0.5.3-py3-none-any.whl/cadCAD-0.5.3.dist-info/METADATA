cadCAD (complex adaptive systems computer-aided design) is a python based, unified modeling framework for stochastic
dynamical systems and differential games for research, validation, and Computer Aided Design of economic systems created
by BlockScience. It is capable of modeling systems at all levels of abstraction from Agent Based Modeling (ABM) to
System Dynamics (SD), and enabling smooth integration of computational social science simulations with empirical data
science workflows.

An economic system is treated as a state-based model and defined through a set of endogenous and exogenous state
variables which are updated through mechanisms and environmental processes, respectively. Behavioral models, which may
be deterministic or stochastic, provide the evolution of the system within the action space of the mechanisms.
Mathematical formulations of these economic games treat agent utility as derived from the state rather than direct from
an action, creating a rich, dynamic modeling framework. Simulations may be run with a range of initial conditions and
parameters for states, behaviors, mechanisms, and environmental processes to understand and visualize network behavior
under various conditions. Support for A/B testing policies, Monte Carlo analysis, and other common numerical methods is
provided.
