### Acceleration for production environment
#### PyTorch Module compilation
- [compilation with oneflow_compile](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/onediff_diffusers_extensions/examples/text_to_image_sdxl.py)
#### Avoid compilation time for new input shape
- [Support Multi-resolution input](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/onediff_diffusers_extensions/examples/text_to_image_sdxl.py)
#### Avoid compilation time for online serving
Compile and save the compiled result offline, then load it online for serving
- [Save and Load the compiled graph](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/onediff_diffusers_extensions/examples/text_to_image_sdxl_save_load.py)
- [Change device of the compiled graph to do multi-process serving](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/onediff_diffusers_extensions/examples/text_to_image_sdxl_mp_load.py)
  - Compile at one device(such as device 0), then use the compiled result to other device(such as device 1~7).

### OneDiff Quality Evaluation

We also maintain a repository for benchmarking the quality of generation after acceleration using OneDiff:
[OneDiffGenMetrics](https://github.com/siliconflow/OneDiffGenMetrics)

### OneDiff Enterprise Edition
If you need **Enterprise-level Support** for your system or business, you can
- subscribe to Enterprise Edition online and get all support after the order: https://siliconflow.com/onediff.html
- or send an email to contact@siliconflow.com and tell us about your user case, deployment scale, and requirements.

OneDiff Enterprise Edition can be **subscripted for one month and one GPU** and the cost is low.

## Installation
### OS and GPU support
- Linux
  - If you want to use OneDiff on Windows, please use it under WSL.
- NVIDIA GPUs

### OneDiff Installation

#### 1. Install OneFlow
> **_NOTE:_** We have updated OneFlow frequently for OneDiff, so please install OneFlow by the links below.

- **CUDA 11.8**

  For NA/EU users
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://github.com/siliconflow/oneflow_releases/releases/expanded_assets/community_cu118
  ```

  For CN users
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://oneflow-pro.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/branch/community/cu118
  ```


<details>
<summary> Click to get OneFlow packages for other CUDA versions. </summary>

- **CUDA 12.1**

  For NA/EU users
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://github.com/siliconflow/oneflow_releases/releases/expanded_assets/community_cu121
  ```

  For CN users
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://oneflow-pro.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/branch/community/cu121
  ```


- **CUDA 12.2**

  For NA/EU users
  ```bash 
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://github.com/siliconflow/oneflow_releases/releases/expanded_assets/community_cu122
  ```
  For CN users
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://oneflow-pro.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/branch/community/cu122
  ```



</details>


#### 2. Install torch and diffusers
**Note: You can choose the latest versions you want for diffusers or transformers.**
```
python3 -m pip install "torch" "transformers==4.27.1" "diffusers[torch]==0.19.3"
```


#### 3. Install OneDiff

- From PyPI
```
python3 -m pip install --pre onediff
```
- From source
```
git clone https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff.git
cd onediff && python3 -m pip install -e .
```

> **_NOTE:_** If you intend to utilize plugins for ComfyUI/StableDiffusion-WebUI, we highly recommend installing OneDiff from the source rather than PyPI. This is necessary as you'll need to manually copy (or create a soft link) for the relevant code into the extension folder of these UIs/Libs.

#### 4. (Optional)Login huggingface-cli

```
python3 -m pip install huggingface_hub
 ~/.local/bin/huggingface-cli login
```

## Release

- run examples to check it works

  ```bash
  cd onediff_diffusers_extensions
  python3 examples/text_to_image.py
  ```

- bump version in these files:

  ```
  .github/workflows/pub.yml
  src/onediff/__init__.py
  ```

- install build package
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install build
  ```

- build wheel

  ```bash
  rm -rf dist
  python3 -m build
  ```

- upload to pypi

  ```bash
  twine upload dist/*
  ```
