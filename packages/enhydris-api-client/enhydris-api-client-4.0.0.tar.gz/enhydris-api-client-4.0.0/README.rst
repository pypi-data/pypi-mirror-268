Python API client for Enhydris

* Free software: GNU General Public License v3

This package has some functionality to make it easier to use the
Enhydris API.

Installation
============

``pip install enhydris-api-client``

Example
=======

::

    from enhydris_api_client import EnhydrisApiClient

    with EnhydrisApiClient("https://openmeteo.org", "my_auth_token") as api_client:
        # Get a dict with attrs of station with id=42
        station = api_client.get_model(Station, 42)

        # Create a new station
        api_client.post_model(Station, data={"name": "my station"})


Reference
=========

**EnhydrisApiClient(base_url, token=None)**

Creates and returns an api client. It can also be used as a context
manager, though this is not necessary. If not used as a context manager,
you might get warnings about unclosed sockets.

Not specifying ``token`` is deprecated. ``token`` will become mandatory
in future versions.

``EnhydrisApiClient`` objects have the following methods:

**.get_token(username, password)**

(Deprecated.) Gets an API token from Enhydris and thereafter uses it in
subsequent requests. The method will be removed in future versions.

| **.get_station(id)**
| **.post_station(data)**
| **.put_station(station_id, data)**
| **.patch_station(station_id, data)**
| **.delete_station(station_id)**

Methods that create, retrieve, update or delete stations. The ``data``
argument (for those methods that receive one) is a dictionary.
``get_station()`` returns a dictionary with the data for the station.
``post_station()`` returns the created station's id.

| **.get_timeseries_group(station_id, timeseries_group_id)**
| **.post_timeseries_group(station_id, timeseries_group_id, data)**
| **.put_timeseries_group(station_id, timeseries_group_id, data)**
| **.patch_timeseries_group(station_id, timeseries_group_id, data)**
| **.delete_timeseries_group(station_id, timeseries_group_id)**

Methods that create, retrieve, update or delete time series groups.
Similar to the ones for station.

| **.list_timeseries(station_id, timeseries_group_id)**
| **.get_timeseries(station_id, timeseries_group_id, timeseries_id)**
| **.post_timeseries(station_id, timeseries_group_id, data)**
| **.delete_timeseries(station_id, timeseries_group_id, timeseries_id)**

Methods that create, retrieve or delete time series. Similar to the ones
for station. ``list_timeseries()`` returns a list of dictionaries.

| **.read_tsdata(station_id, timeseries_group_id, timeseries_id, start_date=None, end_date=None, timezone=None)**
| **.post_tsdata(station_id, timeseries_group_id, timeseries_id, ts)**
| **.get_ts_end_date(station_id, timeseries_group_id, timeseries_id, timezone=None)**

Methods that retrieve or update time series data.

``read_ts_data()`` retrieves the time series data into a htimeseries
object that it returns. If ``start_date`` and/or ``end_date`` (aware
datetime objects) are specified, only the part of the time series
between these dates is retrieved. The timestamps are returned in the
specified time zone. If unspecified, then they are returned in the time
zone specified by the station's display_timezone_.

``post_tsdata() `` posts a time series to Enhydris, appending the
records to any already existing.  ``ts`` is a htimeseries object.

``get_ts_end_date()`` returns a ``datetime`` object which is the last
timestamp of the time series. If the time series is empty it returns
``None``. The returned timestamp is always naive, but it is in the specified
``timezone`` (or the station's display_timezone_ if unspecified).
