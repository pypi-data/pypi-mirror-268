Point-Scanning Super-Resolution (**PSSR**)
===========================================

**PSSR** is a standardized `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ workflow for super-resolution tasks using microscopy images.
This is the official reimplementation of the methods described in the original paper: `Deep learning-based point-scanning super-resolution imaging <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01080-z>`_,
containing various improvements and new features.

The **PSSR** User Guide and full API Reference is available in the `PSSR Documentation <https://haydenstites.github.io/PSSR>`_.

If you have never used **PSSR** before, `Getting Started <https://haydenstites.github.io/PSSR/guide/start.html>`_ outlines installation and basic usage.
Full reference and explanations of all **PSSR** tools is available in `API Reference <https://haydenstites.github.io/PSSR/reference/api.html>`_.

The package is still in development. All code can be found here.
If you experience any bugs, unexpected behaviors, or have any suggestions, make sure to `open a ticket <https://github.com/haydenstites/PSSR/issues>`_.
