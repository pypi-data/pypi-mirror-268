# SharePoint Utility Functions

This Python package provides utility functions for working with SharePoint files, including connecting to SharePoint, combining files into a single DataFrame, and uploading a DataFrame to SharePoint as a CSV file.

## Installation

```bash
!pip install sharepoint-utils
```


## Usage

1. `connect_to_sharepoint(username, password, site_address)`

This function connects to a SharePoint site using the provided username, password, and site address.

```python

from sharepoint_utils import connect_to_sharepoint

# Connect to SharePoint
ctx = connect_to_sharepoint('your_username', 'your_password', 'https://your_sharepoint_site_url')

```
\
2. `combine_files_into_dataframe(ctx, folder_url)`

This function combines files from a SharePoint folder into a single pandas DataFrame.

```python

from sharepoint_utils import combine_files_into_dataframe

# Specify the folder path in SharePoint containing the files to be combined into a DataFrame
folder_path = 'relative/folder/path'

# Combine files into a DataFrame
df = combine_files_into_dataframe(ctx, folder_path)
```

\
3. `upload_dataframe_to_sharepoint(ctx, folder, dataframe, file_name)`

This function uploads a pandas DataFrame to a SharePoint folder as a CSV file.

```python
from sharepoint_utils import upload_dataframe_to_sharepoint

# Define folder path
folder_path = '/folder_path/'

# Upload DataFrame to SharePoint folder
upload_dataframe_to_sharepoint(ctx, folder, df, 'your_file_name.csv')
```
