    <b>Infra for building multimodal embeddings from unstructured sources, built in Rust for speed and robustness</b>
</p>

EmbedAnything is a powerful library designed to streamline the creation and management of embedding pipelines. Whether you're working with text, images, audio, or any other type of data., EmbedAnything makes it easy to generate embeddings from multiple sources and store them efficiently in a vector database.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Local Embedding** Works with local embedding models like AllminiLM
- **MultiModality** Works with text and image and will soon expand to audio
- **Python Interface:** Packaged as a Python library for seamless integration into your existing projects.
- **Efficient:** Optimized for speed and performance, with core functionality written in Rust.
- **Scalable:** Store embeddings in a vector database for easy retrieval and scalability.
- **OpenAI** Works with openai as well




## 💚 Installation

`
pip install embed-anything`





# 🧑‍🚀 Getting Started

## For local models 

### To use local embedding: we support Bert and Jina

```python
from embed_anything import *
data = embed_anything.embed_file("filename.pdf", embeder= "Bert")
embeddings = np.array([data.embedding for data in data])
```


## For multimodal embedding: we support CLIP
### Requirements Directory with pictures you want to search for example we have test_files with images of cat, dogs etc

```python
from embed_anything import *
data = embed_anything.embed_directory("test_files", embeder= "Clip")
embeddings = np.array([data.embedding for data in data])

query = "photo of a dog"
query_embedding = np.array(embed_anything.embed_query(query, embeder= "Clip")[0].embedding)
similarities = np.dot(embeddings, query_embedding)
max_index = np.argmax(similarities)
Image.open(data[max_index].text).show()
```


## For OpenAI 
1. Please check if you already have the OpenAI key in the Environment variable.

### If you are using embed-anything==0.1.7 version (latest version)

```python
import embed_anything
data = embed_anything.embed_file("filename.pdf", embeder= "OpenAI")
embeddings = np.array([data.embedding for data in data])
```
