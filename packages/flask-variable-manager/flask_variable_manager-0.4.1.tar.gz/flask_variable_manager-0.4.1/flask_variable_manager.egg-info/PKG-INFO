# Flask Variable Manager

The Flask Variable Manager is a Flask extension that allows you to manage variables within your Flask application. 

It provides an interface to set and get variables, and even render them in Jinja2 templates. 

This can be useful when you need to share data across different parts of your application.

## Installation

To install the Flask Variable Manager, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install flask-variable-manager
```

## Usage

First, import the `VariableManagerExtension` from the `flask_variable_manager` package:

Then, create an instance of the `VariableManagerExtension` and initialize it with your Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_variable_manager import VariableManagerExtension

vm = VariableManagerExtension()
app = Flask(__name__)
vm.init_app(app)
```

Now, you can use the `VariableManagerExtension` to set and get variables in your Flask routes. 

```python
vm._local['my_var'] = 'Hello, World!'
```

```python
vm._local['my_var']
```
