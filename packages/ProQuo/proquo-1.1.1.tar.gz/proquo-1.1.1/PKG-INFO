           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Readme
This repository contains two tools, `ProQuo` and `ProQuoLM`. Both are tools for the detection of short quotations
(<= 4 words) between two texts, a source text and a target text. The target text is the text quoting the source text.
Quotations in the target text need to be marked with quotations marks. For more information, see below.

The main purpose of this tool is to use the pretrained models for the detection of short quotations. While we found both
approaches (`ProQuo` and `ProQuoLM`) to perform at the same level (for details, see our [publication](https://jcls.io/article/id/3590/)),
`ProQuoLm` is easier to use, better maintained and the **recommended approach**.

## Quotation Marks
By default, the "best", that is, most common, combination of opening and closing quotation mark in the specific text is used.
The following combinations are automatically tried:

1. " and "
2. „ and “
3. „ and "
4. “ and “
5. » and «
6. « and »
7. ‘ and ’

If this is not the desired behaviour, quotations marks can be manually defined using the command line options
`--open-quote` and `--close-quote`.

## Approaches Overview
`ProQuo` is a specialized pipeline which uses a [model for reference classification](proquo/model/reference/ReferenceModelTrainer.py)
and a [model for relation extraction](proquo/model/relation/RelationModelBertTrainer.py) between quotations and (page)
references to distinguish between relevant quotations (that is, quotations from the source text) and quotations
from other sources. In a third step, a rule-based algorithm is used to link the identified quotations to their source.

`ProQuoLM` uses a [fine-tuned BERT model](https://huggingface.co/Fredr0id/proquolm) in two ways: to distinguish between
relevant quotations and quotations from other sources and to link the quotations to their source.

## Pretrained Models and Training Data
The pretrained models and training data are made available and can be downloaded from [here](https://scm.cms.hu-berlin.de/schluesselstellen/proquodata).
For `ProQuoLm`, we also provide a model on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Fredr0id/proquolm). This is used by default.

## Installation

### From PyPi
**Note**: Both tools are part of the same PyPi package. So the following command installs both.

~~~
pip install ProQuo
~~~

### From Source
Checkout this repository and then run:

~~~
python -m pip install .
~~~

### Dependencies
Both installation methods install all dependencies except `tensorflow` which needs to be installed manually depending on
the individual needs, see [Tensorflow installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install). The latest version that was tested is 2.14.1.

For `RelationModelLstmTrainer`, `tensorflow-text` is needed. `RelationModelLstmTrainer` should normally not be needed as
`RelationModelBertTrainer` performs better and is the default in the pipeline.

## Usage
The following sections describe how to use ProQuo on the command line.

### Quotation detection
To run `ProQuoLM` with the default model, use the following command:

~~~
proquolm compare path_to_source_text path_to_target_text --text --output-type text

ProQuoLm compare allows the user to find short quotations (<= 4 words) in two
texts, a source text and a target text. The target text is the text quoting
the source text. Quotations in the target text need to be clearly marked with
quotations marks.

positional arguments:
  source-file-path      Path to the source text file
  target-path           Path to the target text file or folder

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --tokenizer TOKENIZER
                        Name of the tokenizer to load from Hugging Face or
                        path to the tokenizer folder
  --model MODEL         Name of the model to load from Hugging Face or path to
                        the model folder
  --lower-case, --no-lower-case
                        Run model inference on lower case text (default: True)
  --output-folder-path OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH
                        The output folder path. If this option is set the
                        output will be saved to a file created in the
                        specified folder
  --create-dated-subfolder, --no-create-dated-subfolder
                        Create a subfolder named with the current date to
                        store the results (default: False)
  --text, --no-text     Include matched text in the returned data structure
                        (default: True)
  --output-type {json,text,csv}
                        The output type
  --csv-sep CSV_SEP     output separator for csv (default: '\t')
  --open-quote OPEN_QUOTE
                        The quotation open character. If this option is not
                        set, then the type of quotation marks used in a target
                        text is auto automatically identified.
  --close-quote CLOSE_QUOTE
                        The quotation close character. If this option is not
                        set, then the type of quotation marks used in a target
                        text is auto automatically identified.
  --include-long-matches-in-result
                        Include matches longer than 4 words in the output
  --max-num-processes MAX_NUM_PROCESSES
                        Maximum number of processes to use for parallel
                        processing. This can significantly speed up the
                        process.

</details>

To run `ProQuo`, use the following command:

~~~
proquo compare path_to_source_text path_to_target_text
path_to_the_reference_vocab_file
path_to_the_reference_model_file
path_to_the_relation_tokenizer_folder
path_to_the_relation_model_folder
--text
--output-type text
~~~

`--output-type text` prints the results to the command line. To save the results to a file, use `--output-type csv` or
`--output-type json`. `--text` includes the quotation text in the output.

The output will look something like this:

~~~
10      15	    500	505	quote	quote
1000	1016	20	36	some other quote	some other quote
~~~

The first two numbers are the character start and end positions in the source text and the other two numbers are the
character start and end positions in the target text.

ProQuo compare allows the user to find short quotations (<= 4 words) in two
texts, a source text and a target text. The target text is the text quoting
the source text. Quotations in the target text need to be clearly marked with
quotations marks.

positional arguments:
  source-file-path      Path to the source text file
  target-path           Path to the target text file or folder
  ref-vocab-file-path   Path to the reference vocab text file
  ref-model-file-path   Path to the reference model file
  rel-tokenizer-folder-path
                        Path to the relation tokenizer folder
  rel-model-folder-path
                        Path to the relation model folder

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --quid-match-path QUID_MATCH_PATH
                        Path to the file or folder with quid matches. If this
                        option is not set, then Quid is used to find long
                        matches.
  --output-folder-path OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH
                        The output folder path. If this option is set the
                        output will be saved to a file created in the
                        specified folder
  --create-dated-subfolder
                        Create a subfolder named with the current date to
                        store the results
  --no-create-dated-subfolder
                        Do not create a subfolder named with the current date
                        to store the results
  --parallel-print-files [PARALLEL_PRINT_FILES ...]
                        Filenames of files which quote a parallel print
                        edition
  --parallel-print-first-page PARALLEL_PRINT_FIRST_PAGE
                        Number of the first page with parallel print
  --parallel-print-last-page PARALLEL_PRINT_LAST_PAGE
                        Number of the last page with parallel print
  --text                Include matched text in the returned data structure
  --no-text             Do not include matched text in the returned data
                        structure
  --ref                 Include matched reference in the returned data
                        structure
  --no-ref              Do not include matched reference in the returned data
                        structure
  --output-type {json,text,csv}
                        The output type
  --csv-sep CSV_SEP     output separator for csv (default: '\t')
  --open-quote OPEN_QUOTE
                        The quotation open character. If this option is not
                        set, then the type of quotation marks used in a target
                        text is auto automatically identified.
  --close-quote CLOSE_QUOTE
                        The quotation close character. If this option is not
                        set, then the type of quotation marks used in a target
                        text is auto automatically identified.
  --include-long-matches-in-result
                        Include matches longer than 4 words in the output
  --max-num-processes MAX_NUM_PROCESSES
                        Maximum number of processes to use for parallel
                        processing.This can significantly speed up the
                        process.

## Parallel processing
`ProQuo` and `ProQuoLM` use [Quid](https://scm.cms.hu-berlin.de/schluesselstellen/quid) in the background which supports
using multiple processes when comparing multiple target texts with the source texts. To use Quid with multiple processes
the command line option `--max-num-processes` is used. The default is 1.

## Training
The library also supports training and testing of custom models. The [Training Readme](Training-Readme.md) gives an introduction to
training models.
