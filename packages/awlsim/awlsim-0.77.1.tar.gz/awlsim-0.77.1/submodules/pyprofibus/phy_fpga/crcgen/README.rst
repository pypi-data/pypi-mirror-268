This tool generates VHDL, Verilog or MyHDL code for use in FPGAs to calculate CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) checksums.

The generated HDL code is synthesizable and combinatorial. That means the calculation runs in one clock cycle on an FPGA.

Any combination of CRC algorithm parameters and polynomial coefficients can be selected.


Example usage
=============

Display all options:

.. code:: sh

	crcgen -h


Generate Verilog code for CRC-32:

.. code:: sh

	crcgen -a CRC-32 -v


Generate VHDL code for CRC-32:

.. code:: sh

	crcgen -a CRC-32 -V


Generate Verilog code for a custom non-standard CRC or any standard algorithm that's not included in crcgen's -a list:

.. code:: sh

	crcgen -P "x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1" -B16 -R -v
