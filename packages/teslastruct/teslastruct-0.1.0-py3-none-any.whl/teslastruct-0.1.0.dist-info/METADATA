# teslastruct
A python library that offers unconventional utils and data structures

## Installation
```
pip install teslastruct
```

## Features
- **Frozendict**: An immutable dictionary that behaves like a standard `dict` but prevents any changes after creation.
- **DictWithDictKeys**: A dictionary that can use other dictionaries as keys.
- **Nothing**: A singleton class that intercepts all attribute and method calls, effectively doing nothing. Useful as a placeholder or a default non-operative object.
- **Onchange Save Dict and List**: Enhanced versions of Python's native `dict` and `list` that automatically save their state whenever any changes occur.

## Usage
### Nothing
```py
from teslastruct.nothing import Nothing
nothing = Nothing()
nothing.x.y("z")
```
works great as a placeholder object

## More is on the way...
- **RecursObj** - nest callable objects obj1(obj2(obj3)) == obj3(obj2(obj1))
- **Better On Change List and Dict** 
- **Code aware objects** - objects that are aware by the ctx of the script
