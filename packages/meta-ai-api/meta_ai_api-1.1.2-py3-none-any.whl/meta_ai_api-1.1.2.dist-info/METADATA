# MetaAI API Wrapper

MetaAI is a Python library designed to interact with Meta's AI APIs that run in the backend of https://www.meta.ai/. It encapsulates the complexities of authentication and communication with the APIs, providing a straightforward interface for sending queries and receiving responses.

With this you can easily prompt the AI with a message and get a response, directly from your Python code. **NO API KEY REQUIRED**

**Meta AI is connected to the internet, so you will be able to get the latest real-time responses from the AI.** (powered by Bing)

Meta AI is running Llama 3 LLM.

## Features
- **Prompt AI**: Send a message to the AI and get a response from Llama 3.
- **Get Up To Date Information**: Get the latest information from the AI thanks to its connection to the internet.
- **Get Sources**: Get the sources of the information provided by the AI.
- **Streaming**: Stream the AI's response in real-time or get the final response.

## Usage
**Download**:

   ```bash
   pip install meta-ai-api
   ```
   
**Initialization**:

```python
from meta_ai_api import MetaAI

ai = MetaAI()
response = ai.prompt(message="Whats the weather in San Francisco today? And what is the date?")
print(response)
 
```
```json
{
   "message":"The weather in San Francisco today is mostly clear to overcast, with no precipitation, a wind speed between 0 and 8 miles per hour and temperatures ranging from 51 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit ¹.
