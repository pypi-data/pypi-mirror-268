sympde
======

|build-status|  |binder|  |docs|

**sympde** is a Symbolic calculus library for partial differential equations and variational forms. It can be used to have similar capabilities as the fenics_ project, by extending and writing your own *printing* functions.

An example of use can be found in psydac_ or gelato_. 

.. _psydac: https://github.com/pyccel/psydac
.. _gelato: https://github.com/pyccel/gelato
.. _fenics: https://fenicsproject.org/

Install
*******

From PyPi
^^^^^^^^^

Simply run, for a local installation::
