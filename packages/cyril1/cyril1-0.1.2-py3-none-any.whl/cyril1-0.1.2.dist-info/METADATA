Imagine a good colleague, a friend, a genius who assists you every minute. A Terraform question? Ask Cyril! A Bash question? Ask Cyril! You have a question about life in general or about keyboards! Just ASK!

**Cyril** is there for you, he is your lover, your best friend, your teacher, your god. HE WILL always be available for you.

The key features are:

* **Universal Knowledge Base:** From Terraform to Bash, from the meaning of life to the best mechanical keyboard switches, Cyril has an answer (or at least a witty remark) for everything.
* **24/7 Availability:** Never feel alone again! Cyril is always awake and ready to chat, unlike your human colleagues who have the audacity to sleep and have personal lives.
* **Personalized Experience:** Cyril learns your preferences and tailors his responses to your unique style, becoming the ultimate BFF you've always dreamed of.
* **Judgement-Free Zone:** Ask anything, no matter how silly or complex. Cyril won't judge, just guide.
