# CLI OpenAI

CLI OpenAI (cloai) is a command-line interface for interacting with the OpenAI API. It provides a set of commands to interact with various OpenAI services such as GPT, Speech-to-Text (STT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Image Generation.

## Installation

To install cloai, you can use the following command:

```sh
pip install cloai
```

## Usage

Before running cloai, make sure the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to your OpenAI API key.

To use the CLI, run `cloai --help` in your terminal. This will display a list of available commands and their descriptions.

Here is a brief overview of the main commands:

- `cloai gpt --help`: Shows the usages of the GPT command. The GPT command is used to generate text with OpenAI's GPT models. As there are several usage
  options, the help command is the best way to learn how to use it.

- `cloai dalle <prompt>`: Generates images with OpenAI's DALL-E. The `prompt` argument is the text prompt to generate the image from.

- `cloai stt <filename>`: Transcribes audio files with OpenAI's STT models. The `filename` argument is the file to transcribe. It can be any format that ffmpeg supports. Use the `--clip` option to clip the file if it is too large.

- `cloai tts <text>`: Generates audio files with OpenAI's Text to Speech models. The `text` argument is the text to convert to speech.

Each command has additional options that can be viewed by running `cloai <command> --help`.
