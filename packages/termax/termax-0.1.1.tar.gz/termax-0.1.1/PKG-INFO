Termax is an LLM agent in your terminal that converts natural language to commands.

<br/>
<p align="center"> <img src="docs/icon_text.svg" alt="..." width=300>

It is featured by:

- üçº Personalized Experience: Optimize the command generation with RAG.
- üìê Supports various LLMs: OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Mistral AI, Baidu Qianfan, and more.
- üß© Shell Extensions: Plugin with popular shells like `zsh`, `bash` and `fish`.

## Installation

```bash
pip install termax
```

## Quick Start

After installation, you'll need to configure the LLM (e.g., set the OpenAI API key). A setup guide will automatically launch the first time you use
Termax. Alternatively, you can manually initiate configuration at any time by running `t config` or `termax config`.

#### Ask Commands

You can start using Termax by asking using command `t` or `termax`, for example:

```bash
t show me the top-5 CPU processes
```

Here is a more complex example:

#### Guess Commands (experimental)

Termax can predict your next move based on your command history‚Äîjust try t guess or termax guess to generate a suggested
command. It's not only smart, it's fun!

```bash
t guess
```

## Shell Plugin

We support various shells like `bash`, `zsh` and `fish`. You can choose to install the plugins by:

```bash
t install -n <plugin>
```

The `<plugin>` can be any of `zsh`, `bash`, or `fish`. With this plugin, you can directly convert natural language into
commands using the Ctrl + K shortcut.

You can also easily uninstall the plugin by:

```bash
t uninstall -n <plugin>
```

Remember to source your shell or restart it after installing or uninstalling plugins to apply changes.

## Contributing

For developers, you can install from source code to enable the latest features and bug fixes.

```bash:
cd <root of this project>
pip install -e .
```

We are using [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) as our coding standard, please read and follow it in case there
are CI errors.
