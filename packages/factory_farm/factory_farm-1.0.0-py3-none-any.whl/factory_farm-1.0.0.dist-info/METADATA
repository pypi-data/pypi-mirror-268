## ⚕️ internal status monitor of the module

To monitor the internal status of the "factory_farm" module:

```
[xonsh] factory_farm internal-status
```
	
These checks are run with pypi "body_scan";   
"factory_farm" is built from a fork of "body_scan".  

The "body_scan" checks are written with "unittest".

## 🌌 Tutorial

### The structure
```
📁 performance
	📜 status_1.py
```

### The checks
```		
# status_1.py

def check_1 ():
	print ("check 1")
	
def check_2 ():
	print ("check 2")
	
def check_3 ():
	raise Exception ("not 110%")

checks = {
	"check 1": check_1,
	"check 2": check_2,
	"check 3": check_3
}
```
		
### The procedure
From the `performance` directory,   
```
[xonsh] factory_farm status
```

#### The report
This is the report that is (hopefully) written to the terminal.  

```
paths: [
	{
		"path": "status_1.py",
		"empty": false,
		"parsed": true,
		"stats": {
			"passes": 2,
			"alarms": 1
		},
		"checks": [
			{
				"check": "check 1",
				"passed": true,
				"elapsed": [
					4.054199962411076e-05,
					"seconds"
				]
			},
			{
				"check": "check 2",
				"passed": true,
				"elapsed": [
					1.72930003827787e-05,
					"seconds"
				]
			},
			{
				"check": "check 3",
				"passed": false,
				"exception": "Exception('not 110%')",
				"exception trace": [
					"Traceback (most recent call last):",
					"  File \"/factory_farm/processes/scan/process/keg/check.py\", line 68, in start",
					"    checks [ check ] ()",
					"  File \"<string>\", line 13, in check_3",
					"Exception: not 110%"
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
alarms: [
	{
		"path": "status_1.py",
		"checks": [
			{
				"check": "check 3",
				"passed": false,
				"exception": "Exception('not 110%')",
				"exception trace": [
					"Traceback (most recent call last):",
					"  File \"/factory_farm/processes/scan/process/keg/check.py\", line 68, in start",
					"    checks [ check ] ()",
					"  File \"<string>\", line 13, in check_3",
					"Exception: not 110%"
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
stats: {
	"alarms": 0,
	"empty": 0,
	"checks": {
		"passes": 2,
		"alarms": 1
	}
}
```
	
### Notes
- Checks are started simultaneously, unless `--simultaneous no`
	- `[xonsh] factory_farm status --simultaneous no`

- The fractory glob pattern is "**/status_*.py", but can be changed with `--glob-string`  
    - `[xonsh] factory_farm status --glob-string "**/performance_*.py"`

## Advanced Tutorial   

It's recommended to run factory_farm in a .py script.    

An example of this can be found in the "_book/advanced tutorial"  
section of the documentation.
