# A basic hexameter foot has a simplified state diagram something like this:
#
#                ,----- -L- -----,
#   (0) -L- (1) <                 >- (7)
#                '- -s- (2) -s- -'
#
# This diagram ignores important features like indeterminate-length
# syllables, correption, and synizesis; those will be added shortly. We
# start at state (0) and accept only a long (-L-) syllable, which
# transitions us to (1). We may then accept either another long or two
# shorts. Either transitions us to (7), either directly (via a -L-) or by
# way of (2) (through two -s- transitions). We can chain this five times for
# the first five feet of the meter, with each foot starting on the end state
# of the last, and then the last foot is a simplified version that accepts a
# long followed by any syllable (represented here as -X-):
#
#   (35) -L- (36) -X- (37)
#
# To account for syllables in the poem that could be either long or short,
# we extend the -L-, -s-, and -X- transitions to accept indeterminate length
# syllables. Correption is handled similarly: Either of the correption
# candidate syllables defined above could serve as either a -L-, -s-, or -X-
# transition.
#
# Synizesis essentially allows us to fuse certain short syllables together
# with a following syllable to produce a long. That means that any -L- or
# -X- transition in our simplified diagram above could also be satisfied by
# a SHORT_SYNIZESIS syllable followed by any other single syllable. And in
# fact this fused syllable may be affected by correption (as in Il. 1.15),
# so any -s- transition could be satisfied by a SHORT_SYNIZESIS followed by
# a correption candidate. This adds some complexity to the simplified
# diagram above. Using -z- for a synizesis transition and -C- for any
# transition representing a correptible syllable, the first foot looks like
# this:
#
#                                 ,-------------- -L- --------------,
#                                /                                   \
#        ,---- -L- ----,        /------------ -z- (4) -X- ------------\
#   (0) <               > (1) -<                                       > (7)
#        ' -z- (3) -X- '        \  ,--- -s- ---,       ,--- -s- ---,  /
#                                '<             > (2) <             >'
#                                  '-z- (5) -C-'       '-z- (6) -C-'
#
# And the sixth foot examds to:
#
#        ,----- -L- ----,        ,----- -L- ----,
#  (35) <                > (36) <                > (37)
#        ' -z- (38) -X- '        ' -z- (39) -X- '
#
# This gets us far, but an unweighted algorithm can't distinguish between a
# scan free of any synizesis or correption and a line that contains many of
# those exceptions. We want to favor scans with as few of these features as
# possible, and so we add a cost to transitions involving synizesis and
# correption. Specifically, additional cost/weight is given to the transitions
# where LONG_CORREPTION transitions in the -s- group (that is, where correption
# occurs), and where SHORT_SYNIZESIS transitions participate in the replacement
# of a long syllable. Note that this cost is not applied when a LONG_CORREPTION
# transitions along a -L- path: This is the normal case of a long syllable
# functioning as a long syllable. The cost is also not applied for an
# INDETERMINATE_CORREPTION syllable in any case: This is a syllable that could
# be either short or long naturally, and so no correption is necessary to
# explain its use as short. Since SHORT_SYNIZESIS is just a short syllable
# normally, its transition along a -s- path similarly has no additional cost.
# Our machine collects all possible matches and reports each with its cost so
# that calling software can report any and all appropriate scansions.
#
# Note that frequently (~1300 lines, e.g., Il. 1.33) won't scan unless we
# scan short syllables as long. Some of these can be explained with a
# dropped digamma, but not all of them. In order to provide some sensible
# scansion, we allow SHORT_SYLLABLES to fill in for LONG_SYLLABLES. We give
# this an arbitrarily high cost so that the path is only taken as a last
# resort.
