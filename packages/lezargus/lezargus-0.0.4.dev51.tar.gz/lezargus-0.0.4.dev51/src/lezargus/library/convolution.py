    function as a whole for maximal precision: volume = 1. We require the
    input of the shape of the kernel to allow for `x_stddev` and `y_stddev`
    to be expressed in pixels to keep it general. By definition, the center
    of the Gaussian kernel is in the center of the array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : tuple
        The shape of the 2D kernel, in pixels.
    x_stddev : float
        The standard deviation of the Gaussian in the x direction, in pixels.
    y_stddev : float
        The standard deviation of the Gaussian in the y direction, in pixels.
    rotation : float
        The rotation angle, increasing counterclockwise, in radians.

    Returns
    -------
    gaussian_kernel : ndarray
        The discrete kernel array.
