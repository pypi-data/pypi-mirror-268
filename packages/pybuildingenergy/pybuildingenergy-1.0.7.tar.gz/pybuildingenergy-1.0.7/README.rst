Features
--------

The new EPBD recast provides an update on building performance assessment through a methodology that must take into account various aspects such as the thermal characteristics of the building, the use of energy from renewable sources, building automation and control systems, ventilation, cooling, energy recovery, etc.

The methodology should represent the actual operating conditions, allow for the use of measured energy for accuracy and comparability purposes, and be based on hourly or sub-hourly intervals that take into account the variable conditions significantly impacting the operation and performance of the system, as well as internal conditions.
The energy performance of a building shall be expressed by a numeric indicator of primary energy use per unit of reference floor area per year, in kWh/(m2.y) for the purpose of both energy performance certification and compliance with minimum energy performance requirements. Numeric indicators of final energy use per unit of reference floor area per year, in kWh/(m2.y) and of energy needs according to ISO 52000 in kWh/(m².y) shall be used. The methodology applied for the determination of the energy performance of a building shall be transparent and open to innovation and reflect best practices, in particular from additional indicators.
Member States shall describe their national calculation methodology based on Annex A of the key European standards on energy performance of buildings, namely EN ISO 52000-1, EN ISO 52003-1, EN ISO 52010-1,EN ISO 52016-1, EN ISO 52018-1,EN 16798-1, EN 52120-1 and EN 17423 or superseding documents. This provision shall not constitute a legal codification of those standards.

**pyBuildingEnergy** aims to provide an assessment of building performance both in terms of energy and comfort. In this initial release, it is possible to assess the energy performance of the building using ISO 52106-1:2018. Additional modules will be added for a more comprehensive evaluation of performance, assessing ventilation, renewable energies, systems, etc.
The actual calculation methods for the assessment of building performance are the following:

- [x] the (sensible) energy need for heating and cooling, based on hourly or monthly calculations;

- [ ] the latent energy need for (de-)humidification, based on hourly or monthly calculations;

- [x] the internal temperature, based on hourly calculations;

- [x] the sensible heating and cooling load, based on hourly calculations;

- [ ] the moisture and latent heat load for (de-)humidification, based on hourly calculations;

- [ ] the design sensible heating or cooling load and design latent heat load using an hourly calculation interval;

- [ ] the conditions of the supply air to provide the necessary humidification and dehumidification.

The calculation methods can be used for residential or non-residential buildings, or a part of it, referred to as "the building" or the "assessed object".
ISO 52016-1:2018 also contains specifications for the assessment of thermal zones in the building or in the part of a building. The calculations are performed per thermal zone. In the calculations, the thermal zones can be assumed to be thermally coupled or not.
ISO 52016-1:2018 is applicable to buildings at the design stage, to new buildings after construction and to existing buildings in the use phase


Weather Data
------------
The tool can use wather data coming from 2 main sources:

- pvgis api (https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/) - PHOTOVOLTAIC GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM
- .epw file from https://www.ladybug.tools/epwmap/

More details in the example folder


Domestic Hot Water - DHW
------------------------
- [x] Calculation of volume and energy need for domestic hot water according to ISO 12831-3. 
- [] Assessment of thermal load based on the type of DHW system


Limitations
------------
The library is developed with the intent of demonstrating specific elements of calculation procedures in the relevant standards. It is not intended to replace the regulations but to complement them, as the latter are essential for understanding the calculation. 
This library is meant to be used for demonstration and testing purposes and is therefore provided as open source, without protection against misuse or inappropriate use.

The information and views set out in this document are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official opinion of the European Union. Neither the European Union institutions and bodies nor any person acting on their behalf may be held responsible for the use that may be made of the information contained herein.

The calculation is currently aimed at single-zone buildings with ground floor. The evaluation of multi-zone buildings is under evaluation.

Getting Started
----------------
The following command will install the latest pyBuildinEnergy library

::

    pip install pybuildingenergy


The tool allows you to evaluate the performance of buildings in different ways: 

* by running simulations of buildings (archetypes) already preloaded in the archetypes.pickle file for different nations according to Tabula dataset (currently only Italian buildings are available, but buildings from different nations will be loaded), 

  ::

      python3 pybuildingenergy --archetype


Here it is possible, to select two options:
  

  . Selection of archetype by providing
  
    * information on building type: single_family_house 
    * period of construction: before 1900, 1901-1920,1921-1945,1946-1960,1961-1875,1976-1990,1991-2005,2006-today 
    * location: 
        **latitude** and **longitude**

  . Demo Building having these features: 

     * single_family_house
     * before 1900,
     * city: Turin
     * lat: 45.071321703968124
     * long: 7.642963669564985
    

* by running best_test600 demo:

  ::

      python3 pybuildingenergy --best_test


* your own building.  For the latter, you can either upload the information from scratch or preload the information from a building archetype and then edit only the information you know.
