Click [here](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SEK-STC31) to learn more about the Sensirion STC3X sensor family.


The measured gas mixture depends on the STC3x product and configured binary gas.
Please refer to the datasheet and API documentation to get a list of supported
binary gases.



## Supported sensor types

| Sensor name                                             | IÂ²C Addresses |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| [STC31-C](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/STC31) | **0x29**      |
| [STC31](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/STC31)   | **0x29**      |

The following instructions and examples use a *STC31-C*.



## Connect the sensor

You can connect your sensor over a [SEK-SensorBridge](https://developer.sensirion.com/sensirion-products/sek-sensorbridge/).
For special setups, you find the sensor pinout in the section below.
