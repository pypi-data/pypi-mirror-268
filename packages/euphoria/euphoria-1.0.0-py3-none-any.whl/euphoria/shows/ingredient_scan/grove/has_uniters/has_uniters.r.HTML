	example:
		['carbohydrates'][][ 2 ]
			['dietary fiber', 'fiber, total dietary'][][ 6 ]
			['sugars, total'][][ 7 ]
				['added sugars', 'sugars, added'][][ 8 ]


		['fats', 'total fat', 'lipids', 'total lipid (fat)'][][ 3 ]
			['monounsaturated fat', 'fatty acids, total monounsaturated'][][ 51 ]
			['polyunsaturated fat', 'fatty acids, total polyunsaturated'][][ 15 ]
			['saturated fat', 'fatty acids, total saturated'][][ 4 ]
			['trans fat', 'fatty acids, total trans'][][ 5 ]

		problems:
			If "added sugars" is included, but "sugars, total" isn't,
			then there's a problem.
			
				"sugars, total" mass = "added sugars" mass
					
					for others this might include "biological activity", etc.
			
			
			If "dietary fiber" is included, but "carbohydrates" isn't,
			then there is a problem, since thusly,
			
				"carbohydrate mass" = "dietary fiber" mass
				
					for others this might include "biological activity", etc.
