"""
If a block of code produces a JSON file, say `out/foo.json`, and if it is not
needed to rerun the block if the output file exists, then a guarded block
handler if an alternative to

```py
if not Path("out/foo.json").exists():
    ...
    if success:
        tb.save_json(result, "out/foo.json")
else:
    result = tb.load_json("out/foo.json")
```

A guarded block handler allows to *guard* an entire block of code, and even a
loop on a per-iteration basis.

## Guarding a simple block

Use it as follows:

```py
h = GuardedBlockHandler("out/foo.json")
for _ in h:
    # This whole block will be skipped if out/foo.json exists
    # If not, don't forget to set the results:
    h.result = ...
# In any case, the results of the block are available in h.result
```

I know the syntax isn't the prettiest, it would be more natural to use a `with
h:` syntax but python doesn't allow for context managers that don't yield...
The handler's `result` is `None` by default. If `h.result` is left to `None`,
no output file is created. This allows for scenarios like

```py
h = GuardedBlockHandler("out/foo.json")
for _ in h:
    ...  # Guarded code
    if success:
        h.result = ...
```

It is also possible to use ["native" saving/loading
methods](https://altaris.github.io/turbo-broccoli/turbo_broccoli/native.html#save):

```py
h = GuardedBlockHandler("out/foo.csv")
for _ in h:
    ...
    h.result = some_pandas_dataframe
```

See `turbo_broccoli.native.save` and `turbo_broccoli.native.load`. Finally, if
the actual result of the block are not needed, use:

```py
h = GuardedBlockHandler("out/large.json", load_if_skip=False)
for _ in h:
    ...
# If the block was skipped (out/large.json already exists), h.result is
# None instead of the content of out/large.json
```

## Guarding a loop

Let's say you have a loop

```py
for x in an_iterable:
    ...  # expensive code that produces a result you want to save
```

You can guard the loop as follows:

```py
h = GuardedBlockHandler("out/foo.json")
for i, x in h(an_iterable):  # an_iterable is always enumerated!
    # h.result is already a dict, no need to initialize it
    ...  # expensive code that produces a result you want to save
    h.result[x] = ...
```

The contents of `h.result` are saved to `out/foo.json` at the end of every
iteration. However, if `out/foo.json` already exists, the loop will skip all
iterations that are already saved. In details, let's say that the contents of
`out/foo.json` is

```json
{"a": "aaa", "b": "bbb"}
```

Then the content of the following loop is only executed for `"c"`:

```py
for i, x in h(["a", "b", "c"]):
    h.result[x] = x * 3
# h.result is now {"a": "aaa", "b": "bbb", "c": "ccc"}
```

If you want `h.result` to be a list instead of a dict, use:

```py
h = GuardedBlockHandler("out/foo.json")
for i, x in h(an_iterable, result_type="list"):
    # h.result is already a list, no need to initialize it
    ...  # expensive code that produces a result you want to save
    h.result.append(...)
```

### Caveats

- Recall that in the case of simple blocks, setting/leaving `h.result` to
  `None` is understood as a failed computation:

  ```py
  for _ in h:
      h.result = None
  for Z_ in h:  # This block isn't skipped
      h.result = "Hello world"
  ```

  In the case of loops however, if an entry of `h.result` is set to `None`, the
  corresponding iteration is not treated as failed. For example:

  ```py
  for i, x in h(["a", "b", "c"]):
      h.result[x] = x * 3 if x != "b" else None
  # h.result is now {"a": "aaa", "b": None, "c": "ccc"}
  for i, x in h(["a", "b", "c"]):
      h.result[x] = x * 3
  # The second loop has been completely skipped, h.result is still
  # {"a": "aaa", "b": None, "c": "ccc"}
  ```

- The `load_if_skip` constructor argument has no effect, meaning that the JSON
  file is always loaded if it exists. If you want some level of laziness,
  consider the following trick:

  ```py
  from turbo_broccoli.context import EmbeddedDict

  h = GuardedBlockHandler("out/foo.json", nodecode_types=["embedded"])
  for i, x in h(["a", "b", "c"]):
      y = ...  # a dict that is expensive to compute
      h.result[x] = EmbeddedDict(y)
  ```

  By changing the type of `y` from a dict to an `EmbeddedDict`, and setting the
  `"embedded"` type in the guarded block handler's internal context's
  `nodecode_types`, results that were already present in the JSON file will not
  be decoded.
