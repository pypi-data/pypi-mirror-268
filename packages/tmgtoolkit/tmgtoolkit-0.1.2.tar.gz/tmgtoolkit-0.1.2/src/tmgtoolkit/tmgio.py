    Returns a TmgExcel namedtuple holding the information in a standard-format

    software distributed with the TMG S1 and S2 measurement systems.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : string
        Path to a TMG measurement Excel file.

    Returns
    -------
    excel : TmgExcel
        A TmgExcel namedtuple holding the data in the Excel file. The TmgExcel
        namedtuple has the following fields:
        - `data` (ndarray): 2D Numpy array holding the TMG signals in the
              inputted Excel file. Measurements are stored in columns, so that
              `data` has shape `(rows, cols)`, where `rows` is the number of
              data points in each TMG measurement and `cols` is the number of
              measurements in the Excel file. Typically `rows` will be 1000,
              since a standard TMG signal is sampled for 1000 ms at 1 kHz.

    Splits the time series in the inputted 2D array `data` into two groups, 1
    and 2, that can then be compared to each other with SPM analysis.

    The function assumes `data` has a well-defined structure, namely that the
    time series in `data` are divided into `numsets` sets, where each set
    consists of `n1` consecutive time series in group 1 followed by `n2`
    consecutive time series in group 2.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        2D Numpy array holding time series data. The time series should be
        stored in columns, so that `data` has shape `(rows, cols)`, where
        `rows` is the number of data points in each time series measurement and
        `cols` is the number of time series.
    numsets : int
        Number of sets in `data`.
    n1 : int
        Number of group 1 time series in each set.
    n2 : int
        Number of group 2 time series in each set.

    Returns
    -------
    data_tuple : tuple
        Tuple holding group 1 and group 2 series. Fields are
        0 (group1) : ndarray
            2D Numpy array holding group 1 measurements.
        1 (group2) : ndarray
            2D Numpy array holding group 2 measurements.
