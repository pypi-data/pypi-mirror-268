class TableFromYolo(_InMemoryRowsTable):
    '''A table populated from a YOLO dataset, defined by a YAML file, a split and optionally a root path.

    The `TableFromYolo` class is an interface between 3LC and the YOLO data format. The YAML file must contain the
    keys `path`, `names` and the provided `split`. If the path in the YAML file is relative, a set of alternatives are
    tried: The directory with the YAML file, the parent of this directory and the
    current working directory.

    :Example:
    ```python
    table = TableFromYolo(
        input_url="path/to/yaml/file.yaml",
        split="train",
    )
    print(table.table_rows[0])
    ```

    :param input_url: The path to the YAML file.
    :param split: The split to use.
