SIMBa (System Identification Methods leveraging Backpropagation) is an open-source toolbox leveraging the Pytorch Automatic Differentiation framework for stable state-space linear SysID. It allows the user to incorporate prior knowledge (like sparsity patterns of the state-space matrices) during the identification procedure.  More details on https://github.com/Cemempamoi/simba.
