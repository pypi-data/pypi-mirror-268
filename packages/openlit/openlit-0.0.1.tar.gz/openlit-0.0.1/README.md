# OpenLIT: OpenTelemetry-native Observability for LLMs

OpenLIT Python SDK is an **OpenTelemetry-native** Auto instrumentation library for monitoring LLM Applications, facilitating the integration of observability into your GenAI-driven projects. Designed with simplicity and efficiency, OpenLIT offers the ability to embed observability into your GenAI-driven projects effortlessly using just **a single line of code**.

Whether you're directly using LLM Libraries like OpenAI, Anthropic or building complex RAG Agents using Langchain, OpenLIT seamlessly integrates observability into your applications, ensuring enhanced performance and reliability across diverse scenarios.

This project adheres to the [Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/tree/main/docs/gen-ai) proposed by the OpenTelemetry community. You can check out the current definitions [here](src/openlit/semcov/__init__.py).

## üíø Installation

## ‚ö° Quick Integration

```python

openlit.init()
```

By default, OpenLIT directs traces and metrics straight to your console. To forward telemetry data to an HTTP OTLP endpoint, such as the OpenTelemetry Collector, set the `otlp_endpoint` parameter with the desired endpoint. Alternatively, you can configure the endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable as recommended in the OpenTelemetry documentation.

To send telemetry to OpenTelemetry backends requiring authentication, set the `otlp_headers` parameter with its desired value. Alternatively, you can configure the endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable as recommended in the OpenTelemetry documentation.



### Configuration

Below is a detailed overview of the configuration options available, allowing you to adjust OpenLIT's behavior and functionality to align with your specific observability needs:

| Argument                | Description                                                                                   | Default Value  | Required |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------|
| `environment`           | The deployment environment of the application.                                                | `"default"`    |    Yes   |
| `application_name`      | Identifies the name of your application.                                                      | `"default"`    |    Yes   |
| `tracer`                | An instance of OpenTelemetry Tracer for tracing operations.                                   | `None`         |    No    |
| `meter`                 | An OpenTelemetry Metrics instance for capturing metrics.                                      | `None`         |    No    |
| `otlp_endpoint`         | Specifies the OTLP endpoint for transmitting telemetry data.                                  | `None`         |    No    |
| `otlp_headers`          | Defines headers for the OTLP exporter, useful for backends requiring authentication.          | `None`         |    No    |
| `disable_batch`         | A flag to disable batch span processing, favoring immediate dispatch.                         | `False`        |    No    |
| `trace_content`         | Enables tracing of content for deeper insights.                                               | `True`         |    No    |
| `disabled_instrumentors`| List of instrumentors to disable. Choices: `["openai", "anthropic", "langchain", "cohere", "mistral", "transformers", "chroma", "pinecone"]`. | `None` |    No    |
| `disable_metrics`       | If set, disables the collection of metrics.                                                   | `False`        |    No    |
