Documenation can be found [here](https://the-crypt-master.readthedocs.io 'Crypt Master Documenation').


ToDo: Validate that registration doesnt change after reboot.  Add better response notifications.  Create proper documenation.

The Crypt Master Client is a simple library for handling import secrets/passwords for application servers.  The secrets are kept on a hardened server, where the client retrieves them through a gatekeeper.

The Crypt Master Server is available [here](https://github.com/TheCryptMaster/CryptMasterServer 'Crypt Master Server').
