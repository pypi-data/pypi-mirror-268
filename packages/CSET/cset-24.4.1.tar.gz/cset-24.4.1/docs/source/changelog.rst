24.4.1 (2024-04-19)
-------------------

This release contains a large generalisation of the CSET workflow, allowing use
of templating to use the same recipe for multiple variables. It also adds
cycling to the workflow, so a long workflow can be efficiently processed in
parallel.

* `@jfrost-mo`_ added GitHub Issue and Pull Request templates, and a detailed
  contribution checklist to the documentation in :pr:`465`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ added a changelog in :pr:`468`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ documented the ``category`` recipe key in :pr:`499`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ renamed the ``steps`` and ``post-steps`` keys to ``parallel``
  and ``collate`` in :pr:`484`. This makes them more meaningful, but is a
  **breaking change**.
* `@daflack`_ added some generic arithmetic operators in :pr:`452`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ made the log output of the read operator nicer in :pr:`461`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ added links to share feedback to the output page in :pr:`442`

* `@jfrost-mo`_ fixed an iris deprecation warning for save_split_attrs in :pr:`459`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ added LFRic specific recipes in :pr:`462`. This allows CSET to
  read in structured LFRic data.
* `@jfrost-mo`_ fixed a memory leak when plotting in :pr:`482`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ included the recipe title in the plot title, giving more context
  to the output. This was :pr:`462`
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ added the capability to loop over model levels in :pr:`441`
* `@Sylviabohnenstengel`_ and `@jfrost-mo`_ renamed and better linked up the
  :doc:`/contributing/index` in :pr:`434` and :pr:`435`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ updated the documentation Actions workflow to make it simpler and
  faster in :pr:`449`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ added a cycling to the cylc workflow so recipes can be run in
  parallel across multiple nodes. This was :pr:`395`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ added looping inside an include file for generalisation in :pr:`387`
* `@jwarner8`_ added a basic regridding operator in :pr:`405`
* `@jfrost-mo`_ made conda-lock update PRs use a GitHub App in :pr:`415`

0.3.0 (2023-08-02)
------------------

This release contains some major changes to the user experience. This includes
many of the CLI commands changing names, and the :doc:`/index` being completely
restructured. Hopefully this should be the last major reshuffle of the user
experience, as we are getting closers to being feature complete for our MVP.

for visualising recipes, and the :ref:`cset-cookbook-command` command for
dumping the built in recipes to disk.

0.1.0 (2023-04-24)
------------------

The first release of CSET! ðŸŽ‰ This release contains basic operators to do
reading, writing, filtering, and plotting of data. It is however still quite
limited in each of them, and still doesn't promise much in the way of API
stability, with things undoubtedly going to undergo significant change in the
near future.

This release also serves as a basis for packaging CSET out into the wider world;
packages will be released on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/CSET/>`_, and
`conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cset>`_.

* Re-enable testing on python 3.11 by `@jfrost-mo`_ in :pr:`61`
