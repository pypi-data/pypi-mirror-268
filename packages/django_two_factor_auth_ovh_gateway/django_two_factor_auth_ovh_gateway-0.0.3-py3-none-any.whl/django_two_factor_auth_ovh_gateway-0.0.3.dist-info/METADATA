# django_two_factor_auth_ovh_gateway


Plugin for [django-two-factor-auth](https://github.com/jazzband/django-two-factor-auth/), adding a gateway for sending SMS using the OVH API.

All you need is your OVH API credentials and the name of the SMS account you want to use.


## Setup

Please see the [django-two-factor-auth documentation](https://django-two-factor-auth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for instructions on how to set up two-factor authentication in your Django project.

```

Then, add the plugin to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    "django_two_factor_auth_ovh_gateway",
]
```

Finally, you need to add the OVH gateway to your `TWO_FACTOR_SMS_GATEWAY` setting:

```python

```
