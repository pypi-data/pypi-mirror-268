A package for maintaining robust, reproducible data management.

## Rationale
Science relies on repeatable results. `rushd` is a Python package that helps with this, both by making sure that the execution context (e.g. the state of all of the Pip packages) is saved, alongside helper functions that help you cleanly, but repeatedly, separate data from code.

## Install
This package is on Pip, so you can just:
```
pip install rushd
```

Alternatively, you can get built wheels from the [Releases tab on Github](https://github.com/GallowayLabMIT/rushd/releases).

## Quickstart
Simply import `rushd`!
```
import rushd as rd
```

## Documentation
See the documentation available at https://gallowaylabmit.github.io/rushd

## Developer install
If you'd like to hack locally on `rushd`, after cloning this repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/GallowayLabMIT/rushd.git
$ cd rushd
```
you can create a local virtual environment, and install `rushd` in "development (editable) mode"
with the extra requirements for tests.
```
$ python -m venv env
$ .\env\Scripts\activate    (on Windows)
$ source env/bin/activate   (on Mac/Linux)
$ pip install -e .[dev]     (on most shells)
$ pip install -e '.[dev]'   (on zsh)
```
After this 'local install', you can use and import `rushd` freely without
having to re-install after each update.

## Changelog
See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed changes.
```
## [0.5.0] - 2024-04-15
### Added
- Added new `rd.plot.debug_axes` which draws guide lines to help with axis alignment.
- Added new `rd.plot.adjust_subplot_margins_inches` which allows subplot configuring
  using inch offsets (instead of subfigure coordinate offsets)

### Modified
- `rd.flow.load_csv_with_metadata` and
  `rd.flow.load_groups_with_metadata` can now load a subset of columns.
- The `datadir.txt` can include paths that use `~` to represent the home directory.
- `rd.plot.generate_xticklabels` does not include metadata key labels in plots without yticklabels
- `rd.plot.generate_xticklabels` no longer throws an error when xticklabels don't match the dictionary passed (instead leaves labels as-is)
- `rd.plot.generate_xticklabels` now enables user-specified line spacing

## What does the name mean?
The name is a reference to [Ibn Rushd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes), a Muslim scholar born in CÃ³rdoba who was responsible for translating and adding scholastic commentary to ancient Greek works, especially Aristotle. His translations spurred further translations into Latin and Hebrew, reigniting interest in ancient Greek works for the first time since the fall of the Roman empire.

His name is pronounced [rush-id](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=%20%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86%20%D8%B1%D8%B4%D8%AF&op=translate).

If we take the first and last letter, we also get `rd`: repeatable data!
