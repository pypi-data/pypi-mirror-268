autoconfigurable - inherited-members
====================================

With the ``inherited-members`` option, we expect traits from the superclass
SampleConfigurable to show up as well as traits from SampleConfigurableSubclass.

.. autoconfigurable:: sample_module.SampleConfigurableSubclass
   :noindex:
   :inherited-members:
