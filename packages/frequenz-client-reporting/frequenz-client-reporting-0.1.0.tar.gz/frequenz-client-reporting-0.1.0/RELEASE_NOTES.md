# Frequenz Reporting API Client Release Notes

## Summary

This release introduces the initial version of the Reporting API client with support for
retrieving historical metrics data for a single component.

## Upgrading

<!-- Here goes notes on how to upgrade from previous versions, including deprecations and what they should be replaced with -->

## New Features

* Introducing the initial version of the Reporting API client, streamlined for
retrieving historical metrics data for a single component. It incorporates
pagination handling and utilizes a wrapper data class that retains the raw
protobuf response while offering transformation capabilities limited here
to generators of structured data representation via named tuples.

* Current limitations include a single component focus with plans for extensibility,
ongoing development for states and bounds integration, as well as support for
service-side features like resampling, streaming, and formula aggregations.

* Code examples are provided to guide users through the basic usage of the client.
The example client is a simple command-line tool that retrieves historical metrics
data for a single component and prints it to the console.
