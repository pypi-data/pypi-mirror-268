# TFV
The tfv package is a suite of tools for post-processing results from the [TUFLOW FV](https://www.tuflow.com/Tuflow%20FV.aspx) hydrodynamic, sediment transport, water quality and particle tracking modelling software. 

It is also provides a basic framework for extracting and visualizing 2D and 3D oceanographic and atmospheric model result data on unstructured meshes.

## Installing
The tfv package is available via the Python Package Index ([PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/tfv/)) or [Conda Forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/tfv-feedstock).

*Note: The latest version has been built and tested on Python 3.9 to 3.12*.

To install tfv from the conda command line tool:

```
conda install -c conda-forge tfv
```

Alternatively to install tfv using pip:

```
python -m pip install tfv
```

## Dependencies
The tfv package depends on the following core packages:

```
matplotlib >= 3.2.2
netCDF4 >= 1.5.3
numpy >= 1.19.0
xarray>=v2022.03.0
dask>=2022.01.0
