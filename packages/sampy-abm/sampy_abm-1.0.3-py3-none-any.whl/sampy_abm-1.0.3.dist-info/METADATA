Sampy is a library designed to simplify ABM development in epidemiology.

A proper documentation with tutorials, benchmarks and examples will be included in the 1.1 version (hopefully, during summer 2024).
In the meantime, the library's content is documented in the code.

More information is available as a preprint at:
