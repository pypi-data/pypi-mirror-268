# algophon
Tools for an algorithmic approach to phonology (some useful to computational phonology and morphology more broadly)

This repository is a work in progress. The README will be updated once the code is in a state that is useable!

## Install

```
pip install algophon
```

## Main Classes

The main classes—those at the top level of the package—allow provide some nice functionality for easily working with strings of phonological segments.

### Segments: `Seg`

### Strings of Segments: `SegStr`

### Segment Inventory: `SegInv`
