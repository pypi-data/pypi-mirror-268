    Example usage:
    ```python
    import reka
    reka.API_KEY = "APIKEY"

    result = reka.completion("What is the capital of the UK?")
    print(completion)  # "The capital of the United Kingdom is London. ..."
    ```

    Args:
        prompt: string.

        model_name: Name of model. You can check available models  with `reka.get_models()`. Defaults to flash.
        request_output_len: Completion length in tokens.
        temperature: Softmax temperature, higher is more diverse.
        random_seed: Seed to obtain different results.
        runtime_top_k: Keep only k top tokens when sampling.
        runtime_top_p: Keep only top p quantile when sampling.
        frequency_penalty: Penalize repetition. 0 means no penalty.
        presence_penalty: Penalize repetition. 0 means no penalty.
        length_penalty: Penalize short answers. 1 means no penalty.
        stop_words: Optional list of words on which to stop generation.

    Returns:
        model completion.
