casa-formats-io
---------------

A small package implementing I/O for CASA data formats - see https://casa-formats-io.readthedocs.io for more details.

While developing this package, we made use of the https://github.com/casacore/casacore package to better understand
the file format and have re-used some of the data class names. Therefore, since some parts of casa-formats-io may
be considered translations of casacore into Python, we license casa-formats-io under the same LGPL license as casacore.


casa-formats-io supports python versions >=3.8.
