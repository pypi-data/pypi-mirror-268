        C2DataViewer is a Python based data viewer for next generation of APS control system (C2).
        It is developed with pyqtgraph, PyQt, and uses pvaPy as pvAccess Python binding.
        This is a viewer for pvData structured data objects as transported by pvAccess. Some use cases are a 'scope viewer',
        and Area Detector images from the AD pva plugin.
