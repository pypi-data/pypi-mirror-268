"""
This submodule implements Likelihood.R from the original implementation in Cython.

It contains functions to compute the log-likelihood score and its gradient without state-space restriction as
well as functions for matrix-vector multiplications with the transition rate matrix and [I-Q]^(-1).
There are also functions to compute the probability distribution represented by an MHN and to sample artificial data
from a given MHN.
