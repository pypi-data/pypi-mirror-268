# Log Time to Tempo

-----

Log your time to tempo on a self-hosted Jira instance from the convenience of your command line.

## Requirements

This tool is developed against

- Jira Server v9.4.17
- Tempo Timesheets 17.2.0 plugin

Any deviation from that setup might lead to issues.
Feel free to provide PRs to support other configurations.

## Installation

```console
pip install log-time-to-tempo
```

## Getting Started

To initialize authentication and local caches of projects and issues, run

```
lt init
```

If you want to enable shell completion (which makes picking issues much easier), run

```
lt --install-completion
```

## Usage

```sh
# log full workday to default issue
lt log
# log 2h to default issue
lt log 2h
# log 2h to specific issue
lt log 2h TSI-1
```

## Configuration


The `lt config` command allows to change the default behavior, either system wide (`--system`) or in the local directory and subdirectories.

Here are a couple of usage examples:

```sh
# Set custom jira instance for all projects (i.e. system-wide)
lt config --system JIRA_INSTANCE https://jira.my-server.com

# Set default issue for worklogs created from current directory (and subdirectories)
lt config LT_LOG_ISSUE TSI-7

# Start all your worklogs at 10am (instead of the default 9am)
lt config --system LT_LOG_FROM_TIME 10

# Remove all custom configuration
lt config --unset
```

## Changes

### [latest] - 2024-XX-XX
[latest]: https://gitlab.codecentric.de/jmm/log-time-to-tempo/-/blob/main/README.md

### [0.0.2] - 2024-04-17
[0.0.2]: https://gitlab.codecentric.de/jmm/log-time-to-tempo/-/blob/0.0.2/README.md

- add `log --lunch` option to reduce the amount of math you have to do in your head when entering your time
  - lunch will simply be deducted from the total duration and your end time
- rename `log --from-time '' --to-time ''` options to `log --start '' --end ''`
- `log --day` is now case-insensitive (so `Mo` will be recognized as `monday`)
- add `--version` flag

### [0.0.1] - 2024-03-25
[0.0.1]: https://gitlab.codecentric.de/jmm/log-time-to-tempo/-/blob/0.0.1/README.md

- authorize with JIRA instance using personal access token
  - prompt for token and persist using [`keyring`][python-keyring] package
- create and list worklogs via tempo's REST API
- list projects and issues using [`jira`][python-jira] API
- cache projects and issues for faster responses and shell completion
