# Contributors' Guidelines

Welcome and thank you for considering contributing to our project! We value your contributions and want to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone. Before contributing, please take a moment to read through these guidelines.

## Code of Conduct

First and foremost, all participants in this project are expected to follow our Code of Conduct. Please read [the Code of Conduct](https://github.com/gatecastle/baler-operator/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in its entirety before contributing. It outlines our expectations for behavior within our community and provides steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How to Contribute

Contributions can take many forms, from bug fixes and feature additions to documentation improvements and more. Here's how you can get started:

### Reporting Bugs or Requesting Features

- Before submitting a bug report or feature request, please check to see if it has already been reported/requested.
- Use the issue tracker to submit new bug reports or feature requests.
- Clearly describe the issue or feature, providing as much relevant information as possible.

### Making Contributions

- Fork the repository and make your changes in a new branch.
- Keep your changes focused and contained to a single issue or feature.
- Follow the coding standards and best practices as much as possible.
- Include tests that cover any new code or fixes, ensuring that your changes don't break anything.
- Update the documentation, if necessary, to reflect your changes or additions.

## Pull Requests (PRs)

When your changes are ready, submit a pull request. Here's what a good PR looks like:

- It's connected to an existing issue, if applicable.
- It includes a concise yet descriptive title and a detailed description of the changes.
- Commits are small and logically separated, with clear commit messages.
- It's up-to-date with the main branch and doesn't have any conflicts.
- It passes all the automated tests (if any are configured).

### PR Review Process

After you submit a PR, the project maintainers will review your changes. The review process may include suggestions for improvements or requests for changes. We aim to review contributions as quickly as possible, but response times may vary depending on the current workload.

We may ask you to make modifications to your proposed changes during the review process. This is a normal part of the contribution process, and we encourage you to view it as a collaborative dialogue aimed at improving the overall quality and utility of the project.

### Merging

Once your PR is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main branch. Congratulations, and thank you for your contribution!

## Questions?

If you have any questions or need further clarification about contributing, please don't hesitate to ask in the issue tracker or reach out to a project maintainer directly.
