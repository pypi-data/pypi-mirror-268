zerocs Description Document
============================

zerocs: zero config service
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. introduction

    1. zerocs is a distributed task framework with extremely simple configuration.
    Enable users to quickly build distributed task systems with minimal
    configuration and learning costs

    2. The framework has functions such as service management, work management,
    and task management, which can meet most usage scenarios

    3. Note: Version 1.9 is not compatible with version 1.3.
    It is recommended to upgrade to version 1.9 and above

    4. Decentralization starting from version 1.9,
    no longer distinguishing between master and slave nodes

2. start using

    1. Please install RabbitMQ before use,
    rabbitmq official website : https://www.rabbitmq.com,
    It is recommended to use Docker installation during testing::

            docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name rabbit \
            -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=user \
            -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=password \
            -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:management

    2. Please install MongoDB before use,
    Installation steps reference : https://docs.mongoing.com/install-mongodb

    3. To use the framework, it is very simple, just refer to zerocs
    in the first line of your startup script
    Please create the corresponding directory and files before starting::

          ├─logs //log directory
          ├─service_list //Directory of microservice codes
          │  │─test
          │  │  ├─test.py
          │  │  ├─test1.py
          ├─main.py  //main
          └─zerocs_test.py //Test Script

    4. main.py ::
